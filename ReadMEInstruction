Some useful links

KiCad placer/organizer - https://github.com/adamws/kicad-kbplacer

QMK software guide (hand wire but basically a guide how to produce a PCB) - https://docs.qmk.fm/hand_wire

QMK software for the actual computing, KLE for layout and have to save the layout to actually use in QMK

PCB routing in sheet and actual PCB can be done with the KBP placer, however, you can get away with making your sheet,
 then using the KBP to place the switches in the accurate positions and route yourself.

KBP will not include any power planes or anything just the switch routes.

Still trying to find the best and easiest switches but from what it looks like cherry and chocolate keys are in almost all Kicad libraries on reddit
as well as finding hot swap sockets for them might be a lot easier.
however, akko v3 keys are cheap on amazon and they apperently click good, can run a test run with and without the hot swap sockets.
